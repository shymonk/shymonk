* About me

Hi, I'm shymonk, a software engineer works with python. I am keen to write more readable code because i believe that:

#+begin_quote
    Programs must be written for people to read, and only
  incidentally for machines to execute.

     -- <The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs>
#+end_quote

moreover, i'm also interest in design.

I choose [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] as editor to write code and usually works on my Macbook Air.
I talk about technology in Chinese and English on this site, all of writings and thoughts are my own.
