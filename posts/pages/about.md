# About me

Hi, I'm shymonk, a software engineer works with python. I am keen to write more readable code because i believe that:

>   Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
> 
>   -- The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

moreover, i'm also interest in design.

I choose [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as editor to write code and usually works on my Macbook Air.  
I talk about technology in Chinese and English on this site, all of writings and thoughts are my own.
